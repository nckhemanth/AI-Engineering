## The Three Headline Shifts

If you read nothing else, internalize these three things.

### 1. The market is paradoxically hot and cold.

Q1 2026 saw ~52,050 tech layoffs (Oracle 30K, Amazon, Meta, Dell), the highest Q1 since 2023 ([Kore1](https://www.kore1.com/tech-layoffs-2026/); [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tech-industry-lays-off-nearly-80-000-employees-in-the-first-quarter-of-2026-almost-50-percent-of-affected-positions-cut-due-to-ai)). Simultaneously, AI roles grew +8.9% QoQ and +4.8% YoY, with ~275,000 unfilled AI roles ([Allwork.space](https://allwork.space/2026/05/ai-hiring-is-rising-even-as-tech-layoffs-surge-140/)). Junior/entry-level engineers were hit hardest - routine codegen, QA testing, basic frontend work disproportionately cut. Senior + specialist AI roles remained resilient.

**Implication:** "Tech hiring" and "AI hiring" are not the same story in 2026. If your career is generalist mid-level SWE work, you're feeling the cold market. If you're AI-specialized at senior level, you're in a sellers' market.

### 2. The title is collapsing; the work is fragmenting.

Most companies now post "AI Engineer" as the umbrella, but inside the role you specialize quickly into RAG, agents, evals, fine-tuning, or platform work. ["Most AI job titles will collapse into 'AI Engineer' over the next 18 months; prestige labels survive only at frontier labs"](https://www.ivanturkovic.com/2026/04/24/ai-job-titles-2026-naming-chaos/). The "Prompt Engineer" standalone title has effectively disappeared from major job boards - the skill survived; the title didn't ([PE Collective](https://pecollective.com/blog/is-prompt-engineering-a-real-career/); [Medium - Prompt Engineering Is Dead 2026](https://medium.com/write-a-catalyst/prompt-engineering-is-dead-2026-ai-systems-engineering-7acdbbcb2160)).

**Implication:** If you're hiring a "Prompt Engineer," you're 18 months behind. Define the actual problem (eval rigor? agent debugging? customer-facing tuning?) and hire for that specific role.

### 3. Forward Deployed Engineer is the breakout role of 2026.

FDE didn't exist as a discrete category at frontier labs in mid-2025. By May 2026, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are all hiring hundreds. Google/Box CEOs publicly called it "the most in-demand job in tech" ([Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/91541878/google-box-ceos-say-this-is-the-most-in-demand-job-in-tech); [Hashnode FDE guide](https://hashnode.com/blog/a-complete-2026-guide-to-the-forward-deployed-engineer)). TC stabilized at $350-550K mid-to-senior.

**Implication:** Frontier-AI buyers (Fortune 500, government, biotech) demand on-site engineering presence as a contractual deliverable. FDE is the role that exists because the buyer values it - not because it's the most efficient way to deliver software.

### Compensation insight

The gap between frontier-lab MTS comp (~$600-795K median at Anthropic/OpenAI) and enterprise AI engineering (~$170-260K mid-level) is **3-5x**. Choose your company tier with eyes open.

---

## Geographic & Industry Distribution

- **Concentration:** 65%+ of AI engineers are in SF + NYC
- **Two-tier market:** Indeed Hiring Lab reports ~95% of hiring firms have NOT posted an AI job - adoption is concentrated among largest firms ([Indeed Hiring Lab Jan 2026](https://www.hiringlab.org/2026/01/16/ai-adoption-accelerating-still-concentrated-among-largest-firms/))
- **Enterprise adoption:** 72% of enterprises have at least one AI workload in production as of Q1 2026 ([Medha Cloud](https://medhacloud.com/blog/ai-adoption-statistics-2026))
- **Consulting boom:** BCG reports 25% of $14.4B 2025 revenue ($3.6B) was AI consulting ([Metaintro BCG](https://www.metaintro.com/blog/bcg-25-percent-ai-revenue-consulting-jobs-2026))
- **International hiring up 82% YoY**; 67% of companies offering relocation packages
- **Remote-friendly:** LangChain ecosystem 35.2% remote, 48.4% hybrid, 16.4% strictly onsite
- **Indeed AI Tracker:** 4.2% of all postings in Dec 2025 - sustained growth amid broader hiring weakness

---

## Interview Process Patterns

The May 2026 standard at AI-native companies:

1. **Recruiter screen** (30 min) - culture/mission + comp + visa
2. **Technical phone screen** (60-90 min) - practical coding, production-style
3. **Take-home** (48 hr - 3 day) - common at LangChain, Mistral, Eightfold; build a small RAG/agent system. ["Not a test of whether you can build, but how - code quality, evals, error handling"](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/ai-engineering-field-guide/blob/main/interview/01-interview-process.md)
4. **Onsite/virtual loop** (4-6 hr): coding round + AI system design + project deep dive + behavioral. ["Whiteboard-only rounds are mostly gone, even Google's format is collaborative now"](https://designgurus.substack.com/p/system-design-interviews-changed)
5. **Hiring manager / values round** - explicit at Anthropic

### AI-role specifics

- **System design rounds** now expect LLM infra, GPU scheduling, vector stores, RAG, eval-gated CI, cost/latency tradeoffs
- **AI-assisted coding rounds** at Meta, Canva, Google, Microsoft, Sierra, Cursor explicitly allow AI tools (Cursor, Copilot, Claude) - evaluating prompt skill and output validation
- **Take-home transparency:** Add an "AI audit note" - what you used AI for, what you changed, why. Transparency beats stealth
- **Sierra:** in-person-only at SF or NY offices; "Plan + Build + Present" 2-hour agent assessment with no algorithm rounds
- **Cursor:** 8-hour take-home using their own product with limited docs and a Slack channel - assesses product sense, autonomy, system design
- **Anthropic:** "the answer that sounds like it was written the night before is a bad signal"

### Frontier-lab specifics

- **Anthropic:** 90-minute, 4-level progressively harder coding problem testing whether you write clean modular code that absorbs new requirements. Values round explicit.
- **OpenAI:** "Design the OpenAI Playground" - wireframes + API + DB schema for thread/message history; multi-tenant secure cloud IDE
- **Mistral (Paris):** 5-round process, no remote, with a dedicated "LLM theory" stage covering transformer internals and alignment

---

## Emerging Roles to Watch

These roles are growing fastest in May 2026 - bet on them if you're planning a 12-month career trajectory.

### Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE)
- **Why:** Frontier-AI buyers (Fortune 500, government, biotech) demand on-site engineering as a contractual deliverable
- **Comp:** $350-550K mid-to-senior at frontier labs
- **Skills:** RAG, fine-tuning, distillation, MCP, customer-facing communication, evals at the customer site
- **Where:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, ElevenLabs, Cohere, Mistral, scale-ups

### AI Evaluation Engineer
- **Why:** Eval matured into a discipline; production needs eval-gated CI/CD
- **Comp:** $100-110/hr contractor; $200-400K FT at frontier labs
- **Skills:** LLM-as-judge calibration, error analysis methodology, statistical correction, dataset curation, regression detection
- **Where:** OpenAI (Applied Evals, Frontier Evals), Apple, Scale AI, Distyl, Apex

### Agentic Systems Engineer
- **Why:** Multi-agent and tool-use are first-class systems engineering
- **Comp:** $84-250K typical; agentic AI architect $260-420K
- **Skills:** LangGraph / multi-agent orchestration, MCP, A2A protocol, agent debugging, tool design, sandbox security
- **Where:** Teradata, GE Vernova, Deloitte, OpenAI (Agent Infrastructure)

### AI Reliability Engineer
- **Why:** Production AI needs SRE-like discipline for non-deterministic systems
- **Comp:** Senior $250-400K at frontier labs (Anthropic posting Staff/Sr roles)
- **Skills:** Incident response for AI agents, runaway-loop containment, cost anomaly detection, multi-provider fallback
- **Where:** Anthropic; "AI SRE" category being defined by Resolve.ai, Rootly

### AI Security Engineer / LLM Red Team Specialist
- **Why:** Prompt injection + jailbreak research became discrete disciplines after the May 2026 AI security inflection (Mythos disclosure, Daybreak, MDASH, first in-the-wild AI-built zero-day)
- **Comp:** $152-230K depending on specialty
- **Skills:** Indirect prompt injection defense, jailbreak research, constitutional classifiers, model supply-chain trust, MCP threat modeling
- **Where:** Life360, frontier labs, security-focused enterprises

### MCP Engineer
- **Why:** MCP ecosystem maturity made server development its own specialty
- **Skills:** MCP server design (HTTP/STDIO), OAuth resource server pattern, agent-card signing, MCP security
- **Where:** Descope, Anthropic-aligned scale-ups, internal platforms at Fortune 500

## Strategic Takeaways

For **engineers** planning the next move:

1. **Position as a specialist, not "Prompt Engineer."** Pick a discipline (evals, agents, RAG, FDE, MLOps) and build depth.
2. **Working portfolio > paper.** Ship 3-5 production-grade projects with evals and observability. Anthropic, OpenAI, and scale-ups all weight this over publications for applied roles.
3. **FDE is high-leverage.** If you can pair technical depth with customer-facing communication, FDE comp at frontier labs is the top of the market outside founder/staff equity at unicorns.
4. **The market is bifurcated.** Generalist mid-level SWE work is being cut. Senior AI specialists are in a sellers' market. Plan your trajectory accordingly.

For **hiring managers** building rubrics:

1. **Hire for the specific problem, not for "AI Engineer."** If you write a generic AI Engineer JD, you'll get generic candidates.
2. **Evaluate shipped systems first.** A take-home that simulates your actual workload (build a small RAG agent for our domain) is more predictive than algorithm puzzles.
3. **AI-assisted coding rounds are now standard.** Watching candidates prompt + validate model output is more informative than blocking AI use.
4. **Comp banding matters.** Frontier-lab comp is creating retention pressure 2 tiers down. If you're an enterprise hiring AI talent, calibrate to local market plus a 15-25% AI premium for senior+.

For **engineering leaders** doing org design:

1. **Map roles to the work, not to titles.** "AI Engineer" is your umbrella. Inside it: name explicit specializations (RAG lead, agent lead, eval lead, platform lead).
2. **Eval Engineer is a real role.** Don't make a feature engineer own the metric they're trying to improve. Separate measurement from delivery.
3. **FDE only pays off above ~$500K customer ARR.** Below that, use solutions engineering. Above, FDE earns its comp through customer-specific engineering that documentation can't generalize.
4. **AI Reliability Engineer is the role you don't know you need yet.** When your first agent loops at 3 AM and burns $50K of API spend before the loop guard fires, you'll wish you had this role 6 months earlier.
