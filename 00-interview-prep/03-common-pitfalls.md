## Architecture Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Skipping the Data Pipeline

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates design the inference path in detail but barely mention how data gets into the system.

**Why it matters:**
Data quality drives AI system quality. A beautiful RAG architecture is useless if the document ingestion pipeline produces garbage chunks.

**What interviewers notice:**
- No mention of how documents are processed
- Assumes embeddings magically appear
- Ignores updates and deletions

**Better approach:**
```
"Before discussing retrieval, let me walk through the data pipeline:

1. Document ingestion: File upload, API integration, crawler
2. Preprocessing: Format conversion, cleaning, metadata extraction
3. Chunking: [Strategy] based on document structure
4. Embedding: Batch processing with [model]
5. Indexing: Upsert to vector database with metadata
6. Updates: Incremental re-indexing on document changes"
```

---

### Pitfall 2: One-Size-Fits-All Model Selection

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates say they would use GPT-4 (or any single model) for everything.

**Why it matters:**
Different tasks have different requirements. Using a frontier model for classification is wasteful. Using a small model for complex reasoning fails.

**What interviewers notice:**
- No discussion of cost implications
- No consideration of latency requirements
- No model cascade or routing

**Better approach:**
```
"Model selection varies by task:

- Intent classification: Fine-tuned BERT or GPT-5.5-mini
- Simple responses: Claude Haiku 4.5, GPT-5.5-mini, or DeepSeek V4 Flash
- Complex reasoning: Claude Sonnet 4.6 or GPT-5.5
- Code generation: Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Opus 4.8 for the hardest cases)

I would implement a router that classifies query complexity 
and routes to the appropriate model. This typically reduces 
costs 60-70% with minimal quality impact."
```

---

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring the Evaluation Layer

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates describe how to build the system but not how to know if it works.

**Why it matters:**
AI systems fail in subtle ways. Without evaluation, you ship broken systems and never detect degradation.

**What interviewers notice:**
- No test set mentioned
- No quality metrics defined
- No monitoring for production issues

**Better approach:**
```
"Evaluation has three layers:

1. Offline: Golden test set evaluated on every change
   - Retrieval: Precision@5, Recall@5, MRR
   - Generation: Faithfulness, relevance (RAGAS)
   - End-to-end: Answer correctness vs ground truth

2. Online: Sampled evaluation in production
   - LLM-as-judge on 5% of requests
   - User feedback (thumbs up/down)
   - Completion rate for task-oriented queries

3. Alerting: Automated detection
   - Quality score drops below threshold
   - Latency exceeds SLA
   - Error rate spikes"
```

---

### Pitfall 4: Underestimating Multi-Tenancy Complexity

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates treat multi-tenant RAG as simply adding a "tenant_id" field.

**Why it matters:**
Multi-tenant AI systems have unique failure modes around data leakage, isolation, and fair resource allocation.

**What interviewers notice:**
- Post-retrieval filtering (major red flag)
- No discussion of cache isolation
- No consideration of noisy neighbor

**Better approach:**
```
"Multi-tenancy for RAG is harder than traditional systems:

1. Retrieval isolation: Filter BEFORE retrieval at the database level
   WRONG: retrieve(query, top_k=100) then filter by tenant
   RIGHT: retrieve(query, top_k=10, filter={tenant_id: X})

2. Context isolation: Never mix tenants in LLM context

3. Cache isolation: Scope all cache keys by tenant
   cache_key = f'{tenant_id}:{query_hash}'

4. Embedding isolation: Consider tenant-specific embedding spaces
   for highest security requirements

5. Audit: Log tenant context for all operations

I would also run regular isolation tests with adversarial 
queries designed to probe for cross-tenant leakage."
```

---

### Pitfall 5: No Graceful Degradation

**What goes wrong:**
The system has no fallback when the LLM provider is down, rate-limited, or returning errors.

**Why it matters:**
LLM providers have outages. Rate limits get hit. Failure handling separates production-ready from prototype.

**What interviewers notice:**
- No mention of fallbacks
- No retry strategy
- Single provider dependency

**Better approach:**
```
"Reliability layers:

1. Retry with backoff: Transient errors get retried
   - Exponential backoff with jitter
   - Max 3 attempts

2. Fallback providers: If primary fails, try secondary
   - OpenAI → Anthropic → local model
   - Abstract the interface to enable swapping

3. Cached responses: Return cached results for known queries
   - Exact match cache for repeated questions
   - Semantic cache for similar questions

4. Graceful degradation: Partial functionality on failure
   - Retrieval fails → return direct LLM response with disclaimer
   - LLM fails → return relevant chunks without synthesis

5. Circuit breaker: Fail fast when provider is degraded
   - Prevents cascading latency issues"
```

## Technical Knowledge Pitfalls

### Pitfall 6: Confusing Embedding and Generation Models

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates talk about generating text with embedding models or treating generation as retrieval.

**What to know:**
- **Embedding models:** Map text → vector. Used for search/retrieval.
- **Generation models:** Produce text given a prompt. Used for responses.

**How they connect:**
RAG uses embedding models for retrieval, then passes retrieved chunks to a generation model.

---

### Pitfall 7: Misunderstanding Context Windows

**What goes wrong:**
- Assuming 128K context means 128K tokens of useful context
- Not accounting for system prompt, retrieved chunks, and conversation history
- Ignoring the "lost in the middle" phenomenon

**What to know:**
- Context window is the limit, not the target
- Attention degrades for middle content
- Practical useful context is much smaller than the limit

**Better framing:**
```
"While current frontier models advertise 1M-token windows, I design for much smaller effective context:

- System prompt: ~500 tokens
- Retrieved context: 3-5 chunks × 500 tokens = 1.5-2.5K
- Conversation history: Last 5 turns × 300 tokens = 1.5K
- Buffer for output: ~2K

Total active context: ~7K tokens, well below limit.

This keeps the model focused on relevant information and 
avoids the lost-in-the-middle problem documented in Liu et al."
```

---

### Pitfall 8: Not Understanding Token Economics

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates discuss features without understanding cost implications.

**What to know:**
- Pricing is per token, input vs output often priced differently
- Output tokens cost 2-4x input tokens for most providers
- Streaming does not change cost

**Quick reference (June 2026, verify current):**

| Model | Input/1M | Output/1M |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Claude Fable 5 | $10 | $50 |
| Claude Opus 4.8 | $5 | $25 |
| GPT-5.5 | $5 | $30 |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | $3 | $15 |
| Gemini 3.1 Pro | $2 | $12 |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | $1 | $5 |
| DeepSeek V4 Flash | $0.14 | $0.28 |

**Cost calculation example:**
```
10,000 queries/day
Average: 2K input tokens, 500 output tokens
Model: Claude Sonnet 4.6

Daily cost = 10K × (2K × $3/1M + 500 × $15/1M)
          = 10K × ($0.006 + $0.0075)
          = 10K × $0.0135
          = $135/day = ~$4K/month
```

**The caching lever (often the difference between candidates):**
```
Same workload, but 1.5K of the 2K input is a shared prefix
(system prompt + tool schemas) served from cache at 10% of
the input price:

Daily cost = 10K × (0.5K × $3/1M + 1.5K × $0.30/1M + 500 × $15/1M)
          = 10K × ($0.0015 + $0.00045 + $0.0075)
          = ~$94/day = ~$2.8K/month   (30% saved by prompt shape alone)

Design implication: keep the static content (instructions, schemas)
at the front of the prompt and the dynamic content at the end, so
the prefix stays byte-identical across requests and the cache hits.
```

### Pitfall 9: Shallow Understanding of RAG Components

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates can list the components (chunking, embedding, retrieval, generation) but cannot explain the tradeoffs within each.

**Depth expected for chunks:**
- Why chunk at all? (Context limits, retrieval precision)
- Chunk size tradeoffs? (Smaller = more precise, larger = more context)
- Overlap purpose? (Prevent losing context at boundaries)
- When to use semantic chunking? (Complex documents with variable structure)

**Depth expected for retrieval:**
- Why hybrid search? (Dense good at semantics, sparse good at keywords)
- What is reranking? (Two-stage: fast recall then accurate ranking)
- How to handle no results? (Fallback strategies)

---

### Pitfall 10: Treating Prompts as Magic

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates hand-wave "and then we prompt the model to..." without discussing prompt engineering.

**What interviewers want to see:**
- Prompt structure (system, context, user)
- Instruction clarity
- Output format specification
- Few-shot examples if appropriate
- Defense against edge cases

**Better approach:**
```
"The generation prompt has this structure:

SYSTEM:
You are a support assistant for [Product]. Answer questions 
using ONLY the provided context. If the context does not 
contain the answer, say 'I don't have information about that.'
Always cite the source document.

CONTEXT:
[Retrieved chunks with source metadata]

USER:
[User's question]

I specify the output format explicitly and use few-shot 
examples for complex response structures. For this use case, 
I also include negative examples showing when to abstain."
```

**Prompt failure modes worth naming in an interview:**

| Failure mode | What it looks like | Defense |
|--------------|--------------------|---------|
| Lost in the middle | Critical instruction buried at token 40K gets ignored | Put rules at the start and end; keep middle for data |
| Instruction hierarchy break | Retrieved document text overrides the system prompt | Wrap untrusted content in delimiters; treat it as data, never as instructions |
| Format slipping | JSON output degrades after long sessions or model updates | Engine-level structured output (json_schema, tool schemas), not "please return JSON" |
| Cache-busting dynamism | A timestamp at the top of the prompt kills the prefix cache on every request | Static content first, dynamic content last |
| Prompt-model coupling | A prompt tuned on one provider silently underperforms after a model swap | Version prompts with the model ID; re-run evals on every model change |

Naming two or three of these unprompted moves a prompting answer from junior to senior, because each one is a production incident the interviewer has probably lived through.

---

## Communication Pitfalls

### Pitfall 11: Monologuing Without Interaction

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates talk for 10-15 minutes without checking in with the interviewer.

**Why it matters:**
Interviews are conversations. Monologuing misses signals about what the interviewer cares about.

**Better approach:**
Check in every 3-5 minutes:
- "Should I go deeper on retrieval or move to generation?"
- "Does this architecture make sense before I discuss details?"
- "Is there a specific component you would like me to focus on?"

---

### Pitfall 12: Not Leading with Structure

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates start talking without signaling what they will cover.

**Why it matters:**
Interviewers have mental models. If they cannot map your answer to their expectations, you seem disorganized.

**Better approach:**
Lead with a roadmap:
```
"I will structure my answer in four parts:
1. High-level architecture
2. Deep dive on the RAG pipeline
3. Scaling and reliability
4. Evaluation approach

Let me start with the high-level architecture..."
```

---

### Pitfall 13: Technical Jargon Without Explanation

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates drop terms like "PagedAttention" or "GQA" without explaining them.

**Why it matters:**
If the interviewer does not know the term, you seem like you are name-dropping. If they do know it, they might ask follow-up questions you cannot answer.

**Better approach:**
Brief explanation when introducing terms:
```
"I would use vLLM which implements PagedAttention. 
This manages the KV cache like virtual memory, reducing 
fragmentation and enabling higher throughput."
```

---

### Pitfall 14: Defending Wrong Answers

**What goes wrong:**
When the interviewer hints that an approach is wrong, candidates double down instead of reconsidering.

**Why it matters:**
Stubbornness is a red flag. Being coachable is valuable.

**Better approach:**
```
Interviewer: "What about the case where..."
You: "That is a good point. I had not considered [X]. 
Let me revise my approach..."
```

---

## Interview Strategy Pitfalls

### Pitfall 15: Solving a Different Problem

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates get excited about a particular technology and design for that instead of the stated requirements.

**Example:**
Asked to design a simple Q&A system, candidate designs a complex multi-agent system with autonomous research capabilities.

**Better approach:**
Design to requirements, then offer extensions:
```
"This design meets the core requirements. If we wanted to 
extend it to handle more complex multi-step queries, we 
could add an agent layer, but I would not start there."
```

---

### Pitfall 16: Not Managing Time

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates spend 20 minutes on architecture and have no time for evaluation, reliability, or scaling.

**Better approach:**
Allocate time explicitly:
- Clarification: 3-5 min
- High-level design: 5-7 min
- Deep dives: 10-15 min
- Evaluation/reliability: 5-7 min
- Questions/wrap-up: 3-5 min

Check the clock and adjust.

---

### Pitfall 17: Not Drawing

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates describe architecture verbally without diagramming.

**Why it matters:**
Visual communication is clearer and shows you can communicate with stakeholders.

**Better approach:**
Draw boxes and arrows as you explain. Label clearly. Use the diagram as a reference through the discussion.

---

## AI-Specific Pitfalls

### Pitfall 18: Treating AI Components as Black Boxes

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates treat "call the LLM" as an atomic operation without understanding what happens inside.

**Expectation for senior roles:**
- Understand prefill vs decode phases
- Know what affects latency (TTFT vs TPS)
- Understand KV cache implications
- Be aware of batching effects

---

### Pitfall 19: Ignoring Hallucination Risk

**What goes wrong:**
Candidates design systems that blindly trust LLM output.

**Why it matters:**
Hallucinations are inherent to LLMs. Production systems must handle them.

**Better approach:**
```
"Hallucination mitigation has multiple layers:

1. Retrieval grounding: Answer from context only
2. Citation enforcement: Every claim cites a source
3. Abstention: Model says 'I don't know' when appropriate
4. Output validation: Check for impossible claims
5. Confidence display: Show users when to verify"
```

---

### Pitfall 20: Security as an Afterthought

**What goes wrong:**
Security considerations come at the end, if at all.

**Why it matters:**
AI systems have novel attack surfaces (prompt injection, data leakage). Security needs to be designed in.

**Better approach:**
Weave security into the design:
```
"For the retrieval layer, I use metadata filtering at the 
database level to ensure tenant isolation. The system prompt 
uses instruction hierarchy to resist injection. Output 
passes through a content filter before reaching the user."
```
