# Microsoft Agent Framework, CrewAI, and the Agent SDK Landscape (April 2026)

In 2025-2026, the multi-agent framework landscape consolidated significantly. Microsoft **retired AutoGen** and merged it with Semantic Kernel into the unified **Microsoft Agent Framework** (RC 1.0, February 2026). CrewAI matured to v1.13 with enterprise-grade features and reported use by 60%+ of Fortune 500 companies. Meanwhile, every major AI lab shipped its own agent SDK: Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK, OpenAI's Agents SDK, and Google's ADK.

## CrewAI: The Manager Perspective

CrewAI is built around the concept of a **Process**.
- **Role-Based Agents**: You define a "Researcher," a "Writer," and a "Manager."
- **Tasks**: Explicit goals with specific outputs.
- **Process Orchestration**: Sequential, Hierarchical, or Consensual (Consensus-based).

### CrewAI Flows (2025 Addition)

CrewAI **Flows** add a **state-machine layer** on top of the classic Crew pattern:

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

class ContentFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def research_topic(self):
        # Returns research output
        return research_crew.kickoff({"topic": self.state["topic"]})
    
    @listen(research_topic)
    def write_article(self, research):
        # Triggered after research completes
        return writing_crew.kickoff({"research": research})
    
    @listen(write_article)
    def publish(self, article):
        # Final step
        return publisher.publish(article)
```

### CrewAI v1.13 (April 2026 Updates)

CrewAI v1.13 marks a turning point toward enterprise production readiness:

- **Enterprise SSO**: Single Sign-On fully documented for enterprise deployments
- **RBAC Improvements**: Role-Based Access Control with a full permissions reference matrix
- **GPT-5 Compatibility**: Fixes for OpenAI's GPT-5 and newer o-series models that dropped support for the `stop` parameter
- **A2A Task Execution**: Agent-to-Agent dynamic task delegation in a structured, deterministic manner
- **NVIDIA NemoClaw Integration**: Infrastructure-level policy enforcement for secure enterprise deployment
- **RuntimeState RootModel**: Unified state serialization for complex workflows

**2026 Use Cases**: CrewAI + Flows is the best framework for **business process automation** (content pipelines, data analysis workflows) where the structure is well-defined. CrewAI reports powering roughly 2 billion agentic executions.

## Microsoft Agent Framework (AutoGen's Successor)

### The Merger: AutoGen + Semantic Kernel = Agent Framework

In late 2025, Microsoft **retired AutoGen as a standalone product** and merged it with Semantic Kernel into the unified **Microsoft Agent Framework**. Release Candidate 1.0 shipped in February 2026, with GA targeted for Q2 2026.

**What the merger combines:**
- **From AutoGen**: Simple abstractions for single- and multi-agent conversation patterns (group chat, round-robin, handoffs)
- **From Semantic Kernel**: Enterprise-grade session management, type safety, filters, telemetry, and extensive model/embedding support

### Migration Path

AutoGen continues to receive bug fixes and security patches, but **new features go exclusively into the Agent Framework**. Microsoft provides an official migration guide. If starting a new project, use the Agent Framework directly.

### Key Capabilities

```python
# Microsoft Agent Framework: Graph-based workflow
from agent_framework import Agent, Workflow, HandoffStep

planner = Agent("Planner", model="gpt-4o", system_message="Decompose tasks.")
executor = Agent("Executor", model="gpt-4o-mini", system_message="Execute sub-tasks.")

workflow = Workflow(
    steps=[
        HandoffStep(from_agent=planner, to_agent=executor),
    ],
    state_management="session",  # Built-in session persistence
)
```

**Framework highlights:**
- **Unified .NET and Python**: Same programming model across both languages
- **Graph-based Workflows**: Sequential, concurrent, handoff, and group chat patterns with explicit control
- **State Management**: Robust session-based persistence for long-running and human-in-the-loop scenarios
- **MCP Support**: Native Model Context Protocol integration for tool access
- **Multi-provider**: Supports OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and local models

## The Agent SDK Landscape (2026)

Every major AI lab now ships its own agent framework. Here is the landscape as of April 2026:

### Claude Agent SDK (Anthropic)

The Claude Agent SDK (renamed from Claude Code SDK in late 2025) provides the same tools, agent loop, and context management that power Claude Code, available as a library in Python and TypeScript.

- **Built-in tools**: File reading, command execution, code editing — agents work immediately without custom tool implementation
- **Supervisor pattern**: Hierarchical agent trees with delegation
- **Deployment**: Supports AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, and Azure
- **As of March 2026**: Python v0.1.48, TypeScript v0.2.71

### OpenAI Agents SDK

OpenAI's lightweight framework for multi-agent workflows using native Python/TypeScript constructs:

- **Handoff-based**: Agents delegate to each other using `Handoff(TargetAgent)` — no central supervisor needed
- **Guardrails**: Built-in input validation and safety checks
- **MCP integration**: Native MCP server tool support
- **Realtime agents**: Voice agent support with gpt-realtime-1.5

### Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)

Google's framework optimized for the Google ecosystem but model-agnostic:

- **Multi-language**: Python, TypeScript, Java, Go (all at 1.0.0 as of early 2026)
- **A2A native**: Built-in Agent-to-Agent protocol support for cross-vendor orchestration
- **Vertex AI integration**: Deploy to Agent Engine Runtime for managed hosting
- **Graph-based**: Agent workflows modeled as directed graphs

> *Verified April 2026.*

## Swarms and P2P

In late 2025, both frameworks have adopted **Swarm Patterns**.
- **The Handoff**: Instead of a central supervisor, agents "Hand off" the conversation to the most relevant expert.
- **Example**: A "Sales Agent" realizes the user is asking a technical question and hands off the thread to the "Support Agent."

## Interview Questions

### Q: When would you use CrewAI instead of LangGraph?

**Strong answer:**
**Speed vs. Precision**. I use **CrewAI** when I need to stand up a team of agents for a standard process (like content generation or data analysis) very quickly. It provides high-level abstractions for "Planning" and "Cooperation" out of the box. I switch to **LangGraph** when I need **Granular Control** over every state transition, multi-turn human-in-the-loop triggers, or complex error-recovery logic that doesn't fit into the "Role-playing team" metaphor.

### Q: Microsoft retired AutoGen in favor of the Agent Framework. How does this affect existing AutoGen deployments?

**Strong answer:**
AutoGen continues to receive bug fixes and security patches, so existing deployments are not immediately broken. However, **all new feature development** is in the Agent Framework. The migration path is well-documented: AutoGen's `AssistantAgent` maps to the Agent Framework's `Agent` class, `GroupChat` maps to the new `Workflow` patterns, and Semantic Kernel's enterprise features (session management, telemetry, filters) are now available natively. The key benefit of migrating is **unified .NET and Python support** and **graph-based workflows** that give explicit control over multi-agent execution paths. For new projects, start with the Agent Framework directly.

### Q: How do you prevent "Infinite Loops" where agents keep talking to each other without solving the task?

**Strong answer:**
We use **Termination Conditions** and **Max Conversational Turns**. We also implement a "Critic Agent" whose only job is to detect if the conversation is stagnant. If the Critic detects circularity, it triggers a user proxy to interrupt or force-switches the group chat manager to a different reasoning path. We also monitor **Token Velocity**: if an agent pair uses 100K tokens in 2 minutes without progress, we kill the session automatically. In 2026, frameworks like the Microsoft Agent Framework and LangGraph provide built-in workflow timeouts and state checkpointing that make loop detection more systematic.
