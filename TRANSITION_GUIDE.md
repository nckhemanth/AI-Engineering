## Transition Paths by Current Role

---

### 1. 🖥️ Backend Engineer → AI Engineering

**Why backend is the best starting point:** You already understand APIs, latency, databases, distributed systems, and production reliability. AI applications need all of these. The gap is mostly domain knowledge, not engineering fundamentals.

#### Target Roles

```

      │
      ├──► LLM Application Engineer       (most common transition, 3–6 months)
      ├──► Agentic Systems Engineer        (3–9 months)
      ├──► AI Infrastructure / MLOps Eng  (6–12 months, needs GPU/serving knowledge)
      └──► RAG Architect                  (4–8 months)
```

#### Target Roles

```
Frontend Engineer
      │
      ├──► AI Product Engineer         (3–6 months — highest demand)
      ├──► AI UX Engineer              (3–6 months, UX focus)
      └──► Full-Stack LLM Engineer     (6–9 months, add backend LLM skills)
```

#### Skill Gap Analysis

| You already have | Gap to close | Priority |
|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| Streaming UI (SSE, WebSocket) | LLM token streaming integration | 🔴 High |

### 3. 🧪 QA Engineer → AI Eval Engineer

**Why QA is the most underrated path:** AI evaluation is essentially a new form of QA. Manual test case design, edge case thinking, regression prevention — these are exactly what AI systems need. But the tools are different, and the mindset around non-deterministic outputs needs to shift.

#### Target Roles

```
QA Engineer
      │
      ├──► AI Eval Engineer            (3–6 months — best fit, fast transition)
      ├──► AI Quality Engineer         (3–6 months)
      └──► Red Team Analyst            (6–9 months, security focus)
```

#### Skill Gap Analysis

| You already have | Gap to close | Priority |
|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| Test case design | Eval dataset creation (dimensional sampling) | 🔴 High |
| Regression testing mindset | Eval suites as CI quality gates | 🔴 High |
| Bug reporting | Error analysis methodology (open/axial coding) | 🔴 High |
| Test automation | LLM-as-judge evaluator automation | 🔴 High |
| Non-functional testing | Hallucination, bias, toxicity detection | 🟡 Medium |
| User acceptance testing | Human annotation workflows | 🟡 Medium |
| N/A | Tracing and observability setup | 🟡 Medium |
| N/A | RAGAS metrics (faithfulness, relevance, recall) | 🟡 Medium |
| N/A | Basic prompt engineering | 🟢 Lower |
| N/A | Python scripting for eval pipelines | 🟢 Lower |

#### Your 90-Day Plan

**Month 1: Error Analysis Foundation**
- Set up Langfuse or Phoenix tracing on any LLM application (your own or open source)
- Do 3 rounds of manual error analysis: review 50 traces, write notes, categorize
- Read the repo's evals companion guides:
  - [AI Evals: Comprehensive Study Guide](ai_evals_comprehensive_study_guide.md)
  - [AI Evals: LangWatch + Langfuse Guide](ai_evals_complete_guide_langwatch_langfuse.md)
- Course chapter to read: *Error Analysis: The Secret Sauce* (inside evals guides, Chapter 3)

**Month 2: Build Evaluators**
- Write 3 code-based evaluators (JSON schema check, format validator, regex-based)
- Write 1 LLM-as-judge evaluator with Train/Dev/Test calibration
- Introduce `judgy` for statistical bias correction
- Read this repo: [14-evaluation-and-observability](14-evaluation-and-observability/)
- Course: *Quality and Safety for LLM Applications* (DeepLearning.AI + WhyLabs, free)

**Month 3: CI/CD Integration**
- Wire evaluators into a GitHub Actions workflow — eval runs on every PR
- Define quality gates (faithfulness > 0.85, format pass rate > 0.99)
- Create a weekly eval report dashboard
- Course: *Evals for AI* (Maven, Hamel + Shreya — paid, worth it for career transition)

#### Portfolio Project Ideas
- Open-source eval suite for a public LLM application
- Blog post: "How I applied QA methodology to catch LLM failures"
- Eval pipeline template repo with LangSmith + GitHub Actions

---

### 4. 📋 Product Manager → AI Product Manager

**Why PMs are uniquely positioned:** AI products fail not because of bad models but because of bad product decisions (wrong problem, wrong eval criteria, wrong success metrics). PMs who understand AI failure modes are extremely rare and highly valued.

#### Target Roles

```
Product Manager
      │
      ├──► AI Product Manager           (3–6 months — direct analog)
      ├──► AI Program Manager           (3–6 months, coordination focus)
      └──► Head of AI Product           (9–18 months, leadership path)
```

#### Skill Gap Analysis

| You already have | Gap to close | Priority |
|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| User research | Error analysis as voice-of-customer | 🔴 High |
| Success metrics definition | AI-specific metrics (faithfulness, completion rate) | 🔴 High |
| Roadmap prioritization | Failure mode prioritization from eval data | 🔴 High |
| A/B testing | LLM A/B testing design (prompt variants, models) | 🔴 High |
| Stakeholder communication | Explaining AI limitations to partners | 🟡 Medium |
| PRD writing | AI system capability docs and constraint documentation | 🟡 Medium |
| N/A | How LLMs work at a high level (no code required) | 🟡 Medium |
| N/A | RAG pipeline concepts | 🟡 Medium |
| N/A | Tracing / observability tools (Langfuse UI) | 🟡 Medium |
| N/A | Prompt engineering basics | 🟢 Lower |

#### Your 90-Day Plan

**Month 1: Build Technical Vocabulary**
- Read this repo's foundations, WITHOUT skipping to code:
  - [01-foundations](01-foundations/) — understand transformers conceptually
  - [02-model-landscape](02-model-landscape/) — know which models exist and what they cost
  - [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) — learn the vocabulary
- Course: *AI for Everyone* (Coursera, Andrew Ng, free) — designed for non-technical roles

**Month 2: Own Error Analysis**
- Ask your engineering team to set up Langfuse or LangSmith
- Personally review 100+ traces from your product — take notes, find patterns
- Run an error analysis session with your team; lead the failure mode categorization
- Read this repo: [14-evaluation-and-observability](14-evaluation-and-observability/)
- Read: Chapter 3 (Error Analysis) in [AI Evals Comprehensive Study Guide](ai_evals_comprehensive_study_guide.md)

**Month 3: Define Your Eval Strategy**
- Write an "AI Quality Spec" for your product: define what good looks like for each feature
- Work with engineers to instrument evals for those criteria
- Set success metrics for your next quarter that include AI quality gates (not just user growth)
- Course: *Evals for AI* (Maven, Hamel + Shreya — explicitly designed for PMs)

#### Skills That Make You Stand Out as an AI PM
- You've personally reviewed traces (most PMs delegate this)
- You can define failure modes quantitatively, not just qualitatively
- You can communicate the cost of quality improvements (prompt changes vs. model upgrades vs. fine-tuning)
- You understand the difference between RAG, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering — and when each is appropriate

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Skipping fundamentals** — Jumping to LangChain before understanding what an embedding is leads to cargo-cult code you can't debug.

2. **Building before evaluating** — Ship nothing without a way to measure quality. Define your eval criteria before writing the first prompt.

3. **Copying prompts without understanding them** — Prompts are engineering decisions. Understand why each element is there.

4. **Ignoring costs until it's too late** — Every API call has a price. Build cost tracking from day one. See [02-model-landscape/03-pricing-and-costs.md](02-model-landscape/03-pricing-and-costs.md).

5. **Assuming the model is the bottleneck** — In most production AI systems, the bottleneck is retrieval quality, prompt design, or data quality. The model is rarely the problem.

6. **Using "latest" in model version strings in production** — Pin exact versions. Silent model updates will break your product.

7. **Over-agenting** — Starting with a 5-agent system when a single well-prompted call would work. Start simple, add complexity only when needed.

## How to Get Hired

**Build in public.** The AI engineering job market rewards demonstrated work:

1. **GitHub portfolio** — One polished end-to-end project beats 10 toy projects
2. **Write a blog post** — Describing one real problem you solved and how (error analysis, eval pipeline, RAG latency fix)
3. **Contribute to open source** — OpenHands, LlamaIndex, DSPy, RAGAS. Even documentation PRs get you noticed.
4. **Use this repo's interview prep** — [00-interview-prep/01-question-bank.md](00-interview-prep/01-question-bank.md) has 80 questions with strong answers

**What to say in interviews:**
- Name specific decisions: "I chose Qdrant over Pinecone because of X" (not "I built a RAG system")
- Cite failure modes you've encountered and how you fixed them
- Know at least one benchmark by heart (SWE-bench, RAGAS scores, TTFT for your serving setup)
- Show you think about eval and cost, not just features
