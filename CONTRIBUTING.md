# Contributing

Thanks for helping keep this guide accurate and useful. It is a living reference for production AI systems and interview prep, so contributions grounded in real-world practice are especially welcome.

## What to contribute

High-value additions include:

- **Interview questions** with staff-level depth and worked answers.
- **Production failure modes** you have hit, plus how you diagnosed and fixed them.
- **Model benchmarks** and pricing updates for confirmed, publicly released models.
- **Corrections** to anything outdated, ambiguous, or wrong.
- **New patterns** (RAG, agents, MCP, eval pipelines, multi-tenant isolation) with concrete tradeoffs.

## How to propose changes

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from the latest `main`.
2. Make your change in focused commits with logical boundaries.
3. Open a pull request describing what changed and why. Link a source for any new model, price, or benchmark claim.

For small fixes (typos, broken links, stale numbers), a direct PR is perfect. For larger additions such as a new chapter or case study, open an issue first so we can align on scope.

## Style conventions

- **No em dashes.** Use commas, parentheses, or a rewrite instead. This applies to prose, commit messages, and code comments.
- **Confirmed-real models only.** Reference models that have actually shipped publicly. Do not invent model names, versions, prices, or benchmark numbers. When you cite pricing or capabilities, link the source.
- **Conventional commits.** Use messages like `docs: fix broken links in case studies` or `feat(retrieval): add ColBERT reranking notes`, scoped to one logical change each.
- **Match the surrounding voice.** Opinionated, concrete, and tradeoff-aware. Prefer specific numbers and named tools over vendor-neutral hedging.
- **Keep links relative** and verify they resolve before opening a PR.

## Quality bar

- Be accurate. If you are unsure, say so or leave it out.
- Be concrete. Name the model, the metric, the failure mode, the cost.
- Be current. This guide tracks what ships, so flag anything that has aged out.
