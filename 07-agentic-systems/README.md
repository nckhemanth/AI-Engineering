# Agentic Systems

Building production AI agents in 2026: reasoning loops, MCP tool use, multi-agent orchestration, memory, planning, error recovery, human-in-the-loop, and evaluation.

Agents are not a single technology. They are a composition of reasoning loop, tool layer, memory, planner, error handler, and evaluator. The 10 chapters in this folder cover each layer in depth, ordered so that earlier chapters establish vocabulary used in later ones.

## Chapter Order

    A[01 Agent fundamentals] --> B[02 Reasoning loops ReAct]
    B --> C[03 Tool use and MCP]
    C --> D[04 Multi-agent orchestration]

```

## Reference Architecture

Each chapter's concepts map to one component of a deployed agent. The diagram below shows where each chapter's material lives in a production system:

## Companion Chapters

- [Tool Use and Computer Agents](../17-tool-use-and-computer-agents/) extends this section with OpenClaw, Computer Use, and the tool-agent landscape.
- [LangGraph Orchestration](../09-frameworks-and-tools/02-langgraph-orchestration.md) is the most common implementation framework for the patterns in this section.
- [Agentic RAG](../06-retrieval-systems/08-agentic-rag.md) intersects agents and retrieval.
- [Reliability and Safety](../13-reliability-and-safety/) extends agentic safety beyond chapter 09's sandboxing.

## Key Takeaways

- Agents are not a single technology; they are a composition of reasoning loop, tool layer, memory, planner, and evaluator. Read chapter 01 first.
- MCP is the standard tool-interop protocol in 2026; do not build custom tool protocols unless you have a strong reason.
- Multi-agent orchestration (ch 04) is over-applied; single-agent with good tooling beats multi-agent for most use cases.
- Memory (ch 05) and error recovery (ch 07) are where most production agent bugs live; budget evaluation effort there.
- Human-in-the-loop (ch 08) is not a fallback; design gates intentionally for high-stakes actions.
