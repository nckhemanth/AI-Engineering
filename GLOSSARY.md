# AI System Design Glossary

Quick reference for key terms used throughout this guide.

**Context7** — MCP server that fetches up-to-date library documentation at runtime, solving the "stale training data" problem for coding agents.

**Context Window** — Maximum number of tokens an LLM can process in a single request. Ranges from 4K to 1M+ tokens.

**Cosine Similarity** — Measure of similarity between two vectors. Standard metric for comparing embeddings.

**Cursor** — AI-native IDE (fork of VS Code) with deep model integration for code completion, agentic editing, and multi-file context awareness.

**DSPy** — Framework for programming LLMs through optimizable modules rather than manual prompts.

---

## E

**Embedding** — Dense vector representation of text. Used for semantic search and similarity comparison.

**Ensemble** — Combining multiple model outputs to improve reliability. Includes voting, debate, and mixture-of-agents.

**Inference** — Running a trained model to generate predictions/outputs.

---

## J

**JSON Mode** — LLM output mode that guarantees valid JSON structure (legacy). Superseded by **Structured Outputs** in newer APIs.

---

## L

**LangChain** — Framework for building LLM applications with chains, agents, and integrations.

**LlamaIndex** — Data framework focused on document processing and retrieval for LLM applications.

**LiveCodeBench** — Benchmark evaluating coding models on real-world problems from competitive programming platforms. More reliable than HumanEval for production coding tasks.

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** — Parameter-efficient fine-tuning that trains small adapter matrices instead of full model weights.

**LLM-as-Judge** — Using an LLM to evaluate outputs from another LLM.

---

## M

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — Anthropic's open protocol for standardized tool/resource integration with LLMs. Version 2.0 (2025) adds Streamable HTTP transport and OAuth 2.1 auth.

**Mixture of Agents (MoA)** — Ensemble pattern where multiple agents contribute to a synthesized response.

**Multi-Tenancy** — Serving multiple customers from shared infrastructure with data isolation.

---

## O

**o3** — OpenAI's high-compute reasoning model (released Jan 2025). Uses internal chain-of-thought to allocate test-time compute. Available in standard and "mini" variants. Excels at math, code, and science.

**OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** — Extracting text from images or scanned documents.

**OpenHands** — Open-source autonomous software engineering agent (formerly OpenDevin). Supports multiple backend LLMs, runs in a Docker sandbox.

---

## P

**Prompt Caching** — Reusing the KV cache for repeated prompt prefixes. Available natively in Anthropic (cache_control), Google (implicit), and some OpenAI endpoints. Reduces cost by 60-90% for long fixed prefixes.
